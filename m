+Unauthorized file access
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+After an encryption key has been added, fscrypt does not hide the
+plaintext file contents or filenames from other users on the same
+system.  Instead, existing access control mechanisms such as file mode
+bits, POSIX ACLs, LSMs, or namespaces should be used for this purpose.
+
+(For the reasoning behind this, understand that while the key is
+added, the confidentiality of the data, from the perspective of the
+system itself, is *not* protected by the mathematical properties of
+encryption but rather only by the correctness of the kernel.
+Therefore, any encryption-specific access control checks would merely
+be enforced by kernel *code* and therefore would be largely redundant
+with the wide variety of access control mechanisms already available.)
+
+Kernel memory compromise
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+An attacker who compromises the system enough to read from arbitrary
+memory, e.g. by mounting a physical attack or by exploiting a kernel
+security vulnerability, can compromise all encryption keys that are
+currently in use.
+
+However, fscrypt allows encryption keys to be removed from the kernel,
+which may protect them from later compromise.
+
+In more detail, the FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY ioctl will wipe a
+master encryption key from kernel memory.  Moreover, it will try to
+evict all cached inodes which had been "unlocked" using the key,
+thereby wiping their per-file keys and making them once again appear
+"locked", i.e. in ciphertext or encrypted form.
+
+However, FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY has some limitations:
+
+- Per-file keys for in-use files will *not* be removed or wiped.
+  Therefore, for maximum effect, userspace should close the relevant
+  encrypted files and directories before removing a master key, as
+  well as kill any processes whose working directory is in an affected
+  encrypted directory.
+
+- The kernel cannot magically wipe copies of the master key(s) that
+  userspace might have as well.  Therefore, userspace must wipe all
+  copies of the master key(s) it makes as well.  Naturally, the same
+  also applies to all higher levels in the key hierarchy.  Userspace
+  should also follow other security precautions such as mlock()ing
+  memory containing keys to prevent it from being swapped out.
+
+- In general, decrypted contents and filenames in the kernel VFS
+  caches are freed but not wiped.  Therefore, portions thereof may be
+  recoverable from freed memory, even after the corresponding key(s)
+  were wiped.  To partially solve this, you can set
+  CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING=y in your kernel config and add page_poison=1
+  to your kernel command line.  However, this has a performance cost.
+
+- Secret keys might still exist in CPU registers, in crypto
+  accelerator hardware (if used by the crypto API to implement any of
+  the algorithms), or in other places not explicitly considered here.
+
+Limitations of v1 policies
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+v1 encryption policies have some weaknesses with respect to online
+attacks:
+
+- There is no verification that the provided master key is correct.
+  Consequently, malicious users can associate the wrong key with
+  encrypted files, even files to which they have only read-only
+  access.
+
+- A compromise of a per-file key also compromises the master key from
+  which it was derived.
+
+- Non-root users cannot securely remove encryption keys.
+
+All the above problems are fixed with v2 encryption policies.  For
+this reason among others, it is recommended to use v2 encryption
+policies on all new encrypted directories.

+Key derivation function
+-----------------------

+With one exception, fscrypt never uses the master key(s) for

+policies.  Users **must not** use the same key for both v1 and v2
+encryption policies.
+
+For v1 encryption policies, the KDF only supports deriving per-file
+encryption keys.  It works by encrypting the master key with
+AES-128-ECB, using the file's 16-byte nonce as the AES key.  The
+resulting ciphertext is used as the derived key.  If the ciphertext is
+longer than needed, then it is truncated to the needed length.
+
+For v2 encryption policies, the KDF is HKDF-SHA512.  The master key is
+passed as the "input keying material", no salt is used, and a distinct
+"application-specific information string" is used for each distinct
+key to be derived.  For example, when a per-file encryption key is
+derived, the application-specific information string is the file's
+nonce prefixed with "fscrypt\0" and a context byte.  Different context
+bytes are used for other types of derived keys.
+
+HKDF-SHA512 is preferred to the original AES-128-ECB based KDF because
+HKDF is more flexible, is nonreversible, and evenly distributes

+
+The caller must initialize ``policy_size`` to the size available for
+the policy struct, i.e. ``sizeof(arg.policy)``.
+
+On success, the policy struct is returned in ``policy``, and its
+actual size is returned in ``policy_size``.  ``policy.version`` should
