Then the inline encryption design is flawed. Block devices tell the
layers above what the minimum unit of atomic IO is via the logical
block size of the device is. Everything above the block device
assumes that it can align and size IO to this size, and the IO will
succeed.

I know what a DUN is. The problem here is that it's the unit of
atomic IO the hardware supports when encryption is enabled....

And that is the fundamental problem here: DUN > logical block size
of the underlying device. i.e. The storage stack does not guarantee
atomicity of such IOs.

If inline encryption increases the size of the atomic unit of IO,
then the logical block size of the device must increase to match it.
If you do that, then the iomap and storage layers will guarantee
that IOs are *always* aligned to DUN boundaries.

Exactly my point. Requiring infrastructure and storage layers to
obey completely new, undefined, undiscoverable, opaque and variable
definition of the block devices' "atomic unit of IO", then that's
simply a non-starter. That requires a complete re-architecture of
the block layers and how things interface and transmit information
through them. At minimum, high level IO alignment constraints must
be generic and not be hidden in context specific crypto structures.

Pretty much.

Performance is irrelevant if correctness is not possible.

Which is just fine if FSB == logical block size.

The existing constraint on filesystems is that FSB >= block device
logical sector size as the filesystem has to be able to do single
block IOs.  For inline encryption, this turns into a constraint on
fscrypt that DUN <= logical block size because it requires IOs to be
aligned to DUNs, not filesystem blocks..

And because of the -implementation limitation- of fscrypt that DUN
== FSB, that means the only valid configuration right now is DUN =
FSB = logical sector size.

Not my problem. If the hardware and/or kernel cannot support the
requirements of the encryption used within the filesystem image,
then it -should error out-.

Please listen to what I'm saying, Eric.

The -current iomap implementation- may provide that behaviour. That
doesn't mean we guarantee that behaviour. i.e. the iomap -design-
does not guaranteee that behaviour, and we don't guarantee such
behaviour into the future. And we won't guarantee this behaviour -
even though the current implementation may provide it - because the
rest of the IO stack below iomap does not provide iomap with that
guarantee.

Hence if iomap cannot get a guarantee that IO it issues won't get
split at some arbitrary boundary, it cannot provide filesystems with
that guarantee.

If that page is "fscrypt+inline encryption is making fundamentally
flawed assumptions about IO stack behaviour" then, yes, we're on the
same page.

And that code that has fundamentally flawed assumptions is grounds
for a NACK, yes?
